      HR. Reports is created and built for the employees. To give Human Resources constant updates, so that they can get the inputs they need to make the workspace as good as possible for the employees.
      When an employee reports something about themselves, weekly or even daily. The accurate departments are able to analyze the data provided, to improve the workspace.
      Give feedback, report when you are feeling well, report when you are feeling bad and give HR updates when there is something that you would like to bring to the staffs attention.
      We hope that when employees are given the opportunity to report how they feel and if there is anything on their minds, that the workspace's overall level of stress decreases.
      When data on how employees are feeling, HR are able to analyse and improve the workspace.
